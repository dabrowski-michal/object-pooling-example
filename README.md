# object-pooling-example

Object pooling is a technique in Unity that allows pre-instantiate all objects that are needed before the application starts. 

Instead of creating and destroying objects during gameplay objects are reused from a "pool".

This techniqe allows spawning a lot of objects without spending too much CPU power.
